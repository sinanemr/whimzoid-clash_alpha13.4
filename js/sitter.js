/**
 * Whimzoid Clash — background NPC for the Kabatepe stage: a guy sitting by the sea, just
 * past the white boat, who occasionally scratches his head. Plain <script>, loaded AFTER
 * engine.js (uses ctx, tGlobal). Pure decoration — drawn in front of the boat but BEHIND
 * the fighters; animation is driven by the synced tGlobal so host and guest match (no sync).
 *
 * Frame 2 is just frame 1 with the arm raised (the body doesn't move), so both frames are
 * drawn at the SAME rect — the body stays put and only the arm animates, no jump. He sits
 * mostly on frame 1 and raises a hand to scratch on some cycles (chosen by a per-cycle hash).
